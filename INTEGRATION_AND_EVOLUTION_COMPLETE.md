## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### **Service Architecture**
```typescript
// All new services follow event-driven architecture
export class GoogleVertexAIService {
  private eventBus: EventBus;
  
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus) {
    this.eventBus = eventBus;
    this.initializeEventListeners();
  }
  
  // Comprehensive API with full TypeScript support
  async createABTest(config: ABTestConfig): Promise<string>
  async generateTextWithABTest(testId: string, request: VertexAIRequest): Promise<ABTestResult>
  async analyzeABTest(testId: string): Promise<AnalysisResult>
}
```

### **Installation Wizard Features**
```typescript
// Step-by-step installation process
const steps = [
  { id: 'welcome', title: 'Welcome', required: true },
  { id: 'apis', title: 'API Setup', required: false },
  { id: 'folders', title: 'Folders', required: true },
  { id: 'complete', title: 'Complete', required: true }
];

// API configuration with external links
const apiConfigs = [
  {
    name: 'Google AI Studio',
    setupUrl: 'https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey',
    description: 'Access to Gemini Pro, Code Gecko, and Imagen models'
  },
  // ... other APIs
];
```

### **Persona Evolution System**
```typescript
// Proactive detection example (Ghost persona)
class GhostProactiveDetection {
  async monitorLogs() {
    this.eventBus.on('log:new_entry', async (logEntry) => {
      const securityMatch = patterns.securityPatterns.find(
        pattern => this.matchesPattern(logEntry, pattern)
      );
      
      if (securityMatch) {
        await this.notifyUser({
          persona: 'Ghost',
          type: 'security_alert',
          message: `Security pattern detected: ${securityMatch.description}`,
          severity: securityMatch.severity,
          context: {
            logEntry,
            relatedIssues: await this.findRelatedIssues(securityMatch),
            recommendations: await this.generateRecommendations(securityMatch)
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
}
```
