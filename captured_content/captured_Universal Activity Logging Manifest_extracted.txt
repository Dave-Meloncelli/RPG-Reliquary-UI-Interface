🌐 Universal Activity Logging & Observability Manifest
Goal:  Enable complete symbolic observability across all Vault agent actions, scroll events, system rituals,
and Commander interventions — while balancing performance and trace granularity.
📌 Logging Principles
Trace Everything, Prioritize What Matters:  All actions generate logs, but only significant
symbolic deltas are retained long-term.
Auto-expire trivial logs  unless flagged by Codex, Architect, or Commander .
Hooks = Checkpoints:  Every @hook invocation writes to the Vault log stream.

JSONPersist as part of Ops Log
🧠 Intelligent Retention Modes
Seal Mode:  Preserve all logs under tag @seal (used during Spiral Lockdown or Scroll Fusion)
Learn Mode:  Short-term memory until Codex confirms pattern recognition
Audit Mode:  AOX/ERDU retain all until Commander grants clearance

📘 Integration Notes:
Codex indexes all logs to Vault/Index/Observability.db
Sophia analyzes Logs/Commander/  for alignment and tone drift
All @hook signatures validated post-run by the Architect
System Load Impact: \~3–5% overhead (acceptable in non-streaming environments) → Recommend
scroll-based sampling logic  for extremely high-frequency agents•
