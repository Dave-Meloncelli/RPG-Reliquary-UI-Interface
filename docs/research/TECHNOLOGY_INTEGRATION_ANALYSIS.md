#### **üéØ IMMEDIATE BUSINESS USE CASES**
1. **Research Team Enhancement** - Replace current research agents with HRM-powered reasoning
2. **Market Analysis** - Complex market trend analysis and prediction
3. **Pricing Optimization** - Advanced pricing strategy development
4. **Content Strategy** - Long-form content planning and optimization

#### **üí∞ REVENUE IMPACT**
- **Research Services**: +$50K annually (enhanced market intelligence)
- **Consulting Services**: +$100K annually (strategic planning)
- **Content Creation**: +$75K annually (high-quality long-form content)

#### **üîß INTEGRATION STRATEGY**
```typescript
// Replace current research agents with HRM
const hrmResearchAgent = {
  name: "HRM Research Lead",
  architecture: "brain-inspired",
  reasoning: "loop-based",
